I only have the free access to ChatGPT so I tried the two-step make description/make image approach. But it complains of being busy...

- prompts_2025-04-28.md
- chatgpt-description.md - from uploaded image of rooms
- claude-description.md
- danja-01.md - I want ice!
- mistral_le-chat.jpg - Mistral's rendering

I haven't tried Groq for images before. It gave me code instead :

- room-orig-broken.py
- room.py - after a pass through Claude to fix
- ice_platform_room.png - the result
