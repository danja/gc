I've attached an image showing sample rooms in a game. Please analyse the image and create a comprehensive description of the style of the rooms such that a designer who hasn't seen the images can create new rooms that are consistent with the style. Format the description in a structured manner with bullet points first, emphasizing key points. Follow that with informal hints that may help the designer create new rooms in this style.

Render the description in markdown as a complete artifact.

I will give you the description of the style of a graphical game, I'd like you to use this to generate a new room for the game in the style according to the scene description that will follow. Make a high quality image of the result.
