### **Visual Style Guide for Room Creation**

#### **General Art Style**
- **Primary Technique**: Pixel art, highly detailed, 2D with an isometric projection.
- **Color Palette**: Rich, saturated colors; distinct color themes per room (e.g., green jungles, blue caves, warm-lit dungeons).
- **Lighting**: Strong use of localized light sources (glowing keys, door outlines, ambient torches); dark, moody backgrounds.
- **Resolution/Scale**: Fine-grained pixel density (~16x16 to 32x32 pixel tiles).

#### **Environment Themes**
- **Outdoor Jungle Ruins**: Mossy stones, vines, scattered vegetation, ancient shrines.
- **Dark Caves/Dungeons**: Cracked stone floors, mysterious glyphs, walls bleeding into blackness.
- **Fantasy Ruins**: Mix of natural elements (trees, waterfalls) with manmade structures (stone arches, altars).

#### **Key Elements**
- **Objects**: 
  - Glowing keys (yellow, red, blue, green).
  - Locked magical doors or barriers with glowing keyhole symbols.
  - Small props (umbrellas, statues, crates, bones) suggesting abandoned or ancient spaces.
- **Characters**: Tiny, adventurer-like sprite (hat, satchel) rendered consistently across scenes.
- **Puzzle Elements**: Keys visibly placed on ground; sometimes blocked by obstacles (boulders, gaps).

#### **Composition**
- **Perspective**: Isometric (30-45° tilt) with clear floor tiles.
- **Room Size**: Small, self-contained scenes; usually fitting 8–12 tiles across.
- **Navigation**: Implicitly single-room puzzles; visual clarity is prioritized (paths, keys, and doors easy to distinguish).

#### **Textures and Details**
- **Flooring**: Modular stone tiles with cracks, moss patches, or engraved designs.
- **Walls**: Short walls (2-3 tiles high), often crumbling or incomplete to maintain visibility.
- **Ambient Effects**: Occasional animated elements suggested (glowing particles, flickering lights).

### **Informal Hints for Designers**

- **Think small**: Rooms are intimate, like a single puzzle screen. No sprawling levels.
- **Over-emphasize the glow**: Keys and doors *must* pop with strong neon-like effects.
- **Suggest mystery**: Keep backgrounds dark and empty or hint at vastness with small visual cues (e.g., fading into darkness).
- **Use color to set mood**: Warm tones for danger/treasure rooms, cool tones for exploration/caves.
- **Prioritize silhouette clarity**: Every important object (key, door, hazard) should be immediately recognizable in shape.
- **Minimal clutter**: Decorative props are sparse but meaningful (one umbrella, a few vines, a couple of broken stones — not busy scenes).
- **Character scale**: Human figures occupy about 1/3 to 1/4 of a floor tile's height; they feel small compared to their environment.

### Follow-up Questions:
**Q1**: Can you break down key types of room mechanics (puzzles, traps, treasures) implied by the designs?  
**Q2**: How would you define a color script or palette map for a whole level built in this style?  
**Q3**: What animation guidelines would help bring this pixel art world to life (e.g., key sparkle, door pulsing)?
