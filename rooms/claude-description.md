# Isometric Room Design Style Guide

## Key Design Elements

### Visual Perspective & Style

- **Isometric Perspective:** Consistent 3/4 view angle with depth shown through layering
- **Pixel Art Aesthetic:** Defined pixel boundaries with limited color palettes
- **Room Structure:** Self-contained, single-screen environments typically featuring square/rectangular boundaries
- **Lighting:** Strong emphasis on atmospheric lighting with glowing elements

### Room Architecture

- **Foundations:** Stone brick or tile platforms, often raised with visible edges
- **Walls:** Low walls or natural boundaries (vegetation, rock formations) define space limits
- **Entrances/Exits:** Doorways, arches, or portals mark transitions between areas
- **Elevation:** Multi-tiered platforms with small staircases or ladders connecting levels

### Color Palette

- **Environment-Based Themes:**
  - Lush greens and browns for jungle/forest areas
  - Deep blues and purples for night scenes
  - Warm oranges and reds for sunset/sunrise environments
  - Dark stone colors with accent lighting for caves/dungeons
- **Consistent Accent Colors:**
  - Bright cyan/teal for magical crystals and energy sources
  - Golden yellow for keys, important items, and light sources
  - Blue-white for portals and dimensional gateways
  - Occasional purple/magenta for special magical elements

### Interactive Elements

- **Portals:** Blue glowing doorways or frame structures, often rectangular
- **Keys:** Golden/yellow key objects required for progression
- **Crystals:** Teal/cyan geometric gems scattered throughout environments
- **Switches/Activators:** Green circular objects that likely trigger mechanisms
- **Hazards:** Glowing snake-like creatures in some darkened rooms

### Environmental Themes

- **Ancient Temple:** Shrine structures, ceremonial spaces with mystical elements
- **Jungle Ruins:** Overgrown stone structures reclaimed by nature
- **Cave Systems:** Dark interiors with limited lighting and natural rock formations
- **Waterfall Areas:** Flowing water features integrated with constructed platforms

### Character Elements

- **Player Character:** Explorer with hat, shown in various areas interacting with environment
- **Scale:** Character size establishes scale of rooms (approximately 5-6 tiles high)

## Designer's Hints & Tips

When creating new rooms in this style, consider these informal suggestions:

1. **Start with a mood** - Decide if your room is mysterious, dangerous, serene, or puzzling before designing its elements. The lighting and color palette should support this emotional tone.

2. **Less is more with colors** - Resist using too many colors. Establish a base palette of 3-4 colors for your environment, then add your accent colors (cyan, yellow, blue) sparingly for interactive elements.

3. **The rule of three** - Each room should contain approximately three interactive elements. Too few makes a room feel empty, too many creates visual noise.

4. **Create depth with overlapping** - Layer elements to create a sense of depth. Foreground elements should partially obscure background elements.

5. **Light as a guide** - Use your glowing elements to naturally draw the player's eye to important areas. The brightest points in your scene should be the most important.

6. **Frame your scene** - Use natural elements like vegetation or architectural features to frame the edges of your room and direct attention inward.

7. **Texture with purpose** - Varied textures (moss on stones, cracks in platforms) add visual interest but should be subtle enough not to distract from interactive elements.

8. **Environmental storytelling** - Include small details that hint at the room's history or purpose without explicit explanation.

9. **Consider the player's path** - Design rooms with clear visual indicators of where the player can and cannot go.

10. **Consistent scale** - Maintain consistent proportions between the character, interactive elements, and environmental features across all rooms.

11. **Shadows and highlights** - Add simple directional shadows to ground objects and subtle highlights to upper edges to enhance the isometric effect.

12. **Breathing space** - Leave some empty areas in your composition to prevent visual overwhelm and to give important elements room to stand out.

Remember that these rooms appear to be part of a larger interconnected world (as shown in the hand-drawn map), so consider how your new room might connect to existing locations thematically and physically.
